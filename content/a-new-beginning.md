It's been almost a month since I started working on revamping the website. I've enjoyed working with frameworks that I have never even heard of before, and I think it's time to call it a day. Ofcourse, a project is never completely finished - there would be iterations over time. 

I am pretty happy with the end result - but ofcourse, there is still room for improvement and a plenty of bugs to fix. I picked up a couple more requirements along the way, like "infinite scrolling" and loading posts on demand rather than at once. These would be implemented/fixed over time, but for now, having the core functionality allows me to continue blogging about my maker journey.
