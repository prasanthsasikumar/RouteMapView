This will be an in-depth guide on creating your own personal blog using Nuxt, a meta-framework built on top of VueJS.¬†

## What we‚Äôll be building

We‚Äôre gonna be building a static blog website with NuxtJS and TailwindCSS. We‚Äôre going to use the Nuxt Content module to quickly write and display blog posts using Markdown. Nuxt Content provides us a seamless and flexible authoring experience to create excellent Content - without needing a Content Management System (CMS).

* We‚Äôre gonna add tags and images to our posts and present them in a nice grid on our homepage.¬†
* Additionally, we‚Äôll add a Table of Content to each individual blog post so users can easily navigate.¬†
* And using the Tailwind Typography plugin, we‚Äôll style our blog posts nicely, including syntax highlighting for code snippets.¬†
* Finally, we‚Äôll make sure our blog posts have the correct meta information so Google and social platforms can index our Content.

This is what the homepage of our blog will look like:

![](/website/homepage_first_iteration.png "homepage_first_iteration")
<h6 class="absolute text-lg -mt-16 text-white px-4 pb-1 text-center">homepage_first_iteration</h6>

And then our blog posts will show their image, tags, ToC and content like so:

![](/website/slug_first_iteration.png "blog post")
<h6 class="absolute text-lg -mt-16 text-white px-4 pb-1 text-center">blog post</h6>

Let‚Äôs get started!
Setup with create-nuxt-app
To set up the project, make sure you have NodeJS installed on your machine and access to a terminal (any terminal will do). You‚Äôll also need either Yarn or npm (comes with NodeJS)

Start by running:

```
npx create-nuxt-app nuxt-content-blog
```

This will ask you a bunch of questions to help you setup the project. Feel free to pick any options you like, but for simplicity, this is what I went with:


![](/website/nuxt_create.png "nuxt create")
<h6 class="absolute text-lg -mt-16 text-white px-4 pb-1 text-center">nuxt create</h6>

The key thing is that you add the ‚ÄúContent - Git-based headless CMS‚Äù module, which will be driving our blog. I‚Äôm gonna use Tailwind CSS as it provides awesome results and a really nice workflow. It‚Äôll also be helpful when we get to styling our blog post content.

When it‚Äôs done, you can cd into the project. Open it with your favorite editor (I use VS Code) and run yarn dev (or npm run dev). Open your browser and head to localhost:3000 to get greeted by the Nuxt welcome screen:

![](/website/nuxt_welcome.png "nuxt welcome")
<h6 class="absolute text-lg -mt-16 text-white px-4 pb-1 text-center">nuxt welcome</h6>

I installed Vetur extension in VsCode. Just search for it in the Extensions Panel and install it, as it‚Äôll give us a bunch of awesome features and quality of life improvements when writing Vue code.

## Creating and displaying blog posts with Nuxt Content

Now we‚Äôre ready to start building! 
Let‚Äôs start by adding a few more posts. We‚Äôll use frontmatter (which comes automatically with Nuxt Content) to describe some basic data about each of our posts. If you open up hello.md, the frontmatter is the information between the dashes at the top:

```
---
title: Getting started
description: 'Empower your NuxtJS application with @nuxt/content module: write in a content/ directory and fetch your Markdown, JSON, YAML and CSV files through a MongoDB like API, acting as a Git-based Headless CMS.'
---
```

We‚Äôre gonna be adding some fields to our frontmatter, so rename hello.md to first-post.md and make it look like the following:

```
---
title: My first blog post
image: first-post.jpg
tags:
  - Front-end
  - Programming
  - Career
---
```

Now, copy paste this post in the same directory to create a couple more. Update their filename, title, image path and tags to something else to make them unique:

![](/website/three_posts.png "posts")
<h6 class="absolute text-lg -mt-16 text-white px-4 pb-1 text-center">posts</h6>

The image key refers to an image path, and can be any URL on the web. In this case, I‚Äôve added a random image from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) in my static folder. This image will then be available at localhost:3000/first-post.jpg for example. Just make sure the name of the file matches the path provided exactly, and that the images are inside the static folder.

Here we‚Äôre using the $content feature from Nuxt to load in some post data (the title, image, tags and slug of each post). We then sort them in descending order (newest first), and call fetch() to execute the function. Finally we‚Äôre returning posts, which exposes the post data to our template as an array of posts. Check the console to see all the data we just grabbed:

![](/website/console.png "console")
<h6 class="absolute text-lg -mt-16 text-white px-4 pb-1 text-center">console</h6>

Let‚Äôs update our template to show the title of each post (still in index.vue):

```js
<template>
  <div>
    <h1 class="text-7xl font-black text-center">New on the blog</h1>
    <div v-for="post in posts" :key="post.title">
      <h2 class="mt-2 text-3xl font-semibold">{{ post.title }}</h2>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```
If all went well, you should see your 3 post titles on the screen - and remember that this title is coming directly from the frontmatter of each individual post, so feel free to update the titles to something else. We‚Äôre also fetching the slug, image and tags as we‚Äôll need those in a bit.

## Creating post routes
Of course we want each post to have it‚Äôs own page to display the body content, tags, image etc. We‚Äôll do that by creating a dynamic route in Nuxt.

Inside your pages folder, create a new folder called blog. Then, create a single file called _slug.vue inside the blog folder. This will be our dynamic route that will display an individual post. Add the following code:

```js
<template>
  <h1>{{ post.title }}</h1>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  async asyncData({ $content, params }) {
    const post = await $content(params.slug).fetch()
    return { post }
  },
}
</script>
```

Now what‚Äôs going on here? Because we named the file _slug.vue and put it inside a blog folder, Nuxt will render this page component whenever it hits a URL at /blog/something. And when it does, the params object in asyncData will have access to the slug (the part of the URL after blog/, in this case ‚Äúsomething‚Äù). We then use that slug to fetch a single post using the $content feature again. By returning post, we expose this data to the template, just like we did on the homepage when fetching all the posts.

To verify that it works, visit localhost:3000/blog/first-post and you should see the post title ‚ÄúMy first blog post‚Äù on the screen. Because first-post is the slug, that slug gets matched up with our markdown file first-post.md.

## Creating proper post previews
Now that we know our blog post routes are working, let‚Äôs go back to index.vue and make our post previews more appealing and actually link them to the individual posts. Let‚Äôs update the post loop to use a new PostPreview component that we‚Äôll create in a second, and pass each post object to this component. We‚Äôll also wrap the loop in a list with some grid classes to make them align nicely. With these changes, our template in index.vue should look like this:

```js
<template>
  <div>
    <h1 class="text-7xl font-black text-center">New on the blog</h1>
    <ul class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-8 mt-8">
      <PostPreview v-for="post in posts" :key="post.slug" :post="post"></PostPreview>
    </ul>
  </div>
</template>
```

Let‚Äôs then create the PostPreview.vue component inside the components folder. This component will accept a post object as a prop, and then display the post image and title, and act as a link to the post itself. We‚Äôll even use another cool new Nuxt feature to get optimized images called Nuxt Image.

Paste the following in your PostPreview.vue file:

```js
<template>
  <li class="transition-all duration-500 ease-in-out">
    <a :href="`/blog/${post.slug}`">
      <NuxtImg
        class="rounded-lg"
        :src="post.image"
        preset="preview"
        width="400"
        height="300"
      />
      <ul v-if="post.tags" class="flex space-x-3 mt-2">
        <li class="text-gray-400 font-bold" v-for="tag in post.tags" :key="tag">
          {{ tag }}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="mt-2 text-3xl font-semibold">{{ post.title }}</h2>
    </a>
  </li>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: {
    post: Object,
  }
}
</script>
```

Now when you look at the homepage, you‚Äôll see the title of each post along with its tags. But now they work as links so you can click each one and go to that post‚Äôs page.

To get the images working, we‚Äôll need to install the @nuxt/image module. Do that by running:

yarn add @nuxt/image

Then, head into your nuxt.config.js and add it to your buildModules array (alongside the Tailwind module that was automatically installed in setup):

```js
buildModules: [
    '@nuxtjs/tailwindcss',
    '@nuxt/image'
],
```


Finally, add the following to nuxt.config.js as well. This will tell @nuxt/image to optimize for different screen sizes and add a preset we‚Äôll use in our PostPreview:

```js
image: {
screens: {
  xs: 320,
  sm: 640,
  md: 768,
  lg: 1024,
  xl: 1280,
  xxl: 1536,
  '2xl': 1536,
},
presets: {
  preview: {
    modifiers: {
      fit: 'cover',
      format: 'jpg',
      width: 400,
      height: 300,
    },
  },
},
}
```

Reload the homepage, and you should now see our images show up:

![](/website/homepage_first_iteration.png "homepage_first_iteration")

## Adding a layout
Great! But the page itself could use some max width to make it look better. There‚Äôs many ways we could do this, but let‚Äôs use another Nuxt feature: Layouts.

Create a new folder in the root of your project called layouts. Inside that, create a file called default.vue and paste the following in there:

```js
<template>
  <div class="min-h-screen w-screen pt-24">
    <div class="max-w-7xl mx-auto">
      <Nuxt />
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {}
</script>
```
## Displaying post content
Now that we got a nice looking homepage, let‚Äôs move on to the actual blog posts in our _slug.vue file. There‚Äôs gonna be a lot going on here, so start by setting your template up like this, and we‚Äôll break it down bit by bit:

```js
<template>
  <article class="grid grid-cols-12 pb-24">
    <NuxtImg
      class="rounded-lg col-start-3 col-span-8 w-full"
      :src="post.image"
      width="768"
      height="509"
    />

    <div class="w-full col-start-1 col-span-12 grid grid-cols-12">
      <nav class="mt-8 col-span-2 shadow-2xl rounded-lg p-4 self-start">
        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li v-for="link of post.toc" :key="link.id">
            <NuxtLink
              class="uppercase tracking-wider text-gray-500 hover:underline"
              :to="`#${link.id}`"
              >{{ link.text }}</NuxtLink>
            >
          </li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
      <div class="col-start-4 col-span-6 w-full">
        <div>
          <NuxtLink to="/" class="block text-gray-400 mt-8">‚Üê Go Back</NuxtLink>
          <ul v-if="post.tags" class="flex space-x-3 mt-2">
            <li
              class="text-gray-400 font-bold"
              v-for="tag in post.tags"
              :key="tag"
            >
              {{ tag }}
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h1 class="text-5xl font-black mt-2">{{ post.title }}</h1>
        </div>
        <nuxt-content class="mt-4 prose max-w-none" :document="post" />
      </div>
    </div>
  </article>
</template>
```


Firstly, we‚Äôre including the post image on top of the page to catch the attention of our reader. Then we add a Table of Content using a special key on our post object that Nuxt Content has added for us called toc. This key is an array with ID‚Äôs of every headline that‚Äôs part of the body content. We use this to add <NuxtLinks> linking to each headline by their ID:

```js
<nav class="mt-8 col-span-2 shadow-2xl rounded-lg p-4 self-start">
  <ul class="space-y-2">
    <li v-for="link of post.toc" :key="link.id">
      <NuxtLink
        class="uppercase tracking-wider text-gray-500 hover:underline"
        :to="`#${link.id}`"
        >{{ link.text }}
      </NuxtLink>
    </li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

Next up, we have some code to display a link back to the homepage, the tags of the post, and the title:

```js
<div>
  <NuxtLink to="/" class="block text-gray-400 mt-8">‚Üê Go Back</NuxtLink>
  <ul v-if="post.tags" class="flex space-x-3 mt-2">
    <li
      class="text-gray-400 font-bold"
      v-for="tag in post.tags"
      :key="tag"
    >
      {{ tag }}
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h1 class="text-5xl font-black mt-2">{{ post.title }}</h1>
</div>
```

And finally, a single (but very important!) line of code:

```js
<nuxt-content class="mt-4 prose max-w-none" :document="post" />
```

This is where we tell Nuxt Content that we want to render the entire body of each blog post. We can install a plugin to provide  better typography defaults. Run:
```
yarn add @tailwindcss/typography
```
To use this plugin, create a tailwind.config.js file in the root of your project and add the following:
```js
module.exports = {
  purge: [
    './components/**/*.{vue,js}',
    './layouts/**/*.vue',
    './pages/**/*.vue',
    './plugins/**/*.{js,ts}',
    './nuxt.config.{js,ts}',
  ],
  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [require('@tailwindcss/typography')],
}
```

All this code is Tailwind specific, so don‚Äôt mind if it doesn‚Äôt make sense to you. But the key is in the plugins array, where we require our newly installed typography plugin. Restart your dev server and head back to the blog post - you should see the content looking MUCH better with great typographic defaults üî•
